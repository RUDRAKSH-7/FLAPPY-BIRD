# What does this project mean?
Its a very basic, not so basic pygame project which features multiple ascepts of coding, especially with the new feature of BEST SCORE, it uses binary file manipulation and file handling algorithms, which is the best way to practically implement the score functionality in the game.
The code itself is not very object oriented is a single file, primarily due to being one of my very initial game projects and me having no knowledge on object oriented at that time. Recent projects do have a very readable code base (for someone who can).
